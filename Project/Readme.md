This project is a reimplementation of the 2018 ICML paper - Learning to Reweight Examples for Robust Deep Learning.
It also is based on the noise types proposed in the 2021-ICLR paper - Learning with Feature-Dependent Label Noise: A Progressive Approach


The code is based on the codes available at
